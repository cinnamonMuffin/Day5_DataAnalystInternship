# Day5_DataAnalystInternship


For this task I first read the dataset and printed some initial statistics.
Then I created count plots of attributes like Survival, Age, Fare, Embarked port, etc
I then proceeded to create visualisations that compare attributes like Age, Gender, Fare, Embarked Port, Passenger class, etc to Survival
Ive also noted down my observations from each of these plots

Thank You.
